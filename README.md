# FILTERING

Enables parsing of expression's to a set of easy to navigate nodes.

## Syntax
The syntax is basic, a single filter looks like this:
```
<property>:<operator>:<value>
name:eq:willem
```

You can chain multiple filters together:
```
<property>:<operator>:<value> <logic> <property>:<operator>:<value>
name:eq:willem AND age:gt:10
```

You can also group filters together:
```
<property>:<operator>:<value> <logic> (<property>:<operator>:<value> <logic> <property>:<operator>:<value>)
name:eq:willem AND (age:gt:10 OR city:neq:amsterdam)
```
